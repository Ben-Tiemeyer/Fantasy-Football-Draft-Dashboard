<b>ACRONYM KEY</b><br/>
<b>ADP</b>: Average Draft Position<br/>
<b>PPG</b>: Points Per Game<br/>
<b>PPG+</b>: Points Per Game Over Replacement Player at given roster position<br/>

<b>COLOR KEY</b><br/>
<b>GRAY</b>: Quarterback (QB)<br/>
<b>GREEN</b>: Running Back (HB)<br/>
<b>BLUE</b>: Wide Receiver (WR)<br/>
<b>PURPLE</b>: Tight End (TE)<br/>
<b>TORQUOISE</b>: Kicker (K)<br/>

<b>PURPOSE</b><br/>
This Dashboard visualizes remaining player value by positional value to optimize roster construction throughout a draft.<br/>
For example, when deciding between two players that have similar PPG projections but different positions, you may notice that one position drops off in value much more drastically after that player than the other position does.<br/><br/>


<b>INPUT DATA</b><br/>
An excel workbook with PPG (Points Per Game) projections for each player in the following format:
